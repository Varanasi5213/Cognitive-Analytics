## Asteroid diameter Prediction
[This Paper](https://github.com/Varanasi5213/Cognitive-Analytics/blob/e7e05881974c7c3d2dbfc18c8a9939f9ed6273ca/Asteroid%20diameter%20Prediction/Asteroid%20diameter.pdf) talks about using Machine Learning Models in Space Research. In this particular case for predicting Asteroid Diameter based on its features like magnitude, neo, PHA, e.t.c. Various models were tested in this paper. I have replicated one of the models and tested the accuracy.uracy.
