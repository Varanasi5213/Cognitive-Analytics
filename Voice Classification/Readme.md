Voice Classification is can be achieved in various ways, most often used method is Fourier transform(decomposing functions depending on space or time into functions depending on frequency). Unlike that, this method uses various statistical parameters of the wave to classify their voices, like Kurtosis, mean, and 5 quartiles.
