## Lasso and Ridge Regression
Lasso and Ridge Regression are regularized versions of linear regression. They use L1 and L2 regularizers for minimizing the chances of overfitting.  Lasso regression not only helps in minimizing over-fitting but can help us in feature selection since it uses L1 regularizer there is a chance of zero coefficients.
